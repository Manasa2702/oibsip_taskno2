       <h2> A Businessman, Philanthropist, Investor, and former chairman of Tata Sons, Tata Group.</h2>
       <p>
         Ratan Tata was born in Bombay, now Mumbai, on 28 December 1937,
                 and is the son of Naval Tata (born in Surat).
                 His biological maternal grandmother had been the sister of Hirabai Tata,
                 wife of group founder Jamshedji Tata. His biological grandfather, Hormusji Tata
                 had belonged to the broader Tata family; Ratan therefore was a Tata by birth.
                 Parents Naval and Sonoo separated in 1948 when Ratan was 10, 
                 and he was subsequently raised by the widow of Sir Ratanji Tata, 
                 his grandmother, Navajbai Tata, who formally adopted him through the J. N. Petit Parsi Orphanage.
                 He has a half-brother, Noel Tata (from Naval Tata's second marriage with Simone Tata),
                 with whom he was raised. His first language is Gujarati.
